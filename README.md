## Answers

* I think my code is robust, because most of it is clean and easy to read. I tryed to make it as much as simple. Part of it is possible to be complicated, because I met with some of technologies like TypeScript and MobX for first time and I am not sure its the right way of using them.
* I would like to add some functionalities like drag and drop tasks, authentication, making teams, chat inside the team, end time of each task and color depends of it.
* I think this task is complexity, because it contains the main parts of Front-End developmet. My rate is 4.
